An NBA MVP prediction project using Python.


Final project for CMSC320. In this project, I implemented a NBA MVP prediction project in python. Throughout this project, I performed data scraping, data visualization, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model construction. These cover all the steps of the data science lifecycle.
